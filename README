In order to protect the 'innocent' I have changed some aspects of this project which need to be 
changed/reconfigured before you successfully pull data from your exchange server.

1.
$_SESSION['loginaccount']  = 'yourprivilegedaccount';
$_SESSION['loginpassword'] = 'yourprivilegedaccountpassword';

2.
@domain.name

3.
https://yourserver/EWS/Exchange.asmx

Search for all instances of the above and replace them.

The file to run in order to get your data back is getCal.php viz:

./getCal.php user.name "startdate" "enddate"

e.g. ./getCal.php john.doe "2013-04-01" "2013-05-31"
